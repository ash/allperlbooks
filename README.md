This repository contains raw data, which are available on the http://allperlbooks.com website.

If you'd like to make a contribution to the data, feel free fixing it and sending a pull request.
It's enough to only update the books.yml file, not caring about any constraints checks against
authors.yml or publishers.yml.

Would you like to upload a book cover completely missing on the site, you are welcome to do that
here: http://allperlbooks.com/upload.

Please note that all the changes made on the site will appear in this repository automatically
but the opposite process is (semi-)manual.
